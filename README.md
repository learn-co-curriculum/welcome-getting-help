# How to Get Help

## Introduction

We don't believe in learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into
other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed.
Together, we can go further than we could ever go alone.

If you get stuck following the instructions, ask! If you get stuck trying to
grasp a coding concept, ask! Instructors and peers from the community will be
glad to help. Equally, if you find someone asking a question that you can
provide insight on, please do! One of the best ways to confirm your own
understanding of a concept is to try and help someone else understand it.
