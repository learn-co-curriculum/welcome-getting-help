# How to Get Help

## Learning Goals

- Know how to get help
- Better understand the purpose of Ask A Question (AAQ) and how it works

## Introduction

We don't believe in learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into
other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed.
Together, we can go further than we could ever go alone. Remember, you are going
to get stuck sometimes! As with any new skill you learn, coding can be difficult
and frustrating. After a certain point, being stuck on a problem becomes
counterproductive - you’re stuck and you need help getting unstuck!

If you get stuck following the instructions or grasping a coding concept, there
are a few things you can do. In this lesson, we'll look at some of the options
available.

## Try Troubleshooting First

Whenever possible, you should try to troubleshoot your issue independently first
before seeking help. 

Some examples of independent troubleshooting might look like:

- Reading the Readme thoroughly for the lesson you’re on to make sure you’re not
  missing relevant details
- Reviewing previous lessons that may apply to the error or issue you’re
  experiencing
- Googling your error or related concepts
- Using debugging tools like [Pry](http://pry.github.io/) to understand your
  error better (we'll introduce Pry to you soon)
- Checking out [Learn's help articles](https://help.learn.co) - these articles include
  advice and answers to frequently asked questions from the Flatiron School
  Team.

Even if you aren't able to find an answer on your own, taking the time to try
the options above can help you clarify the question you're asking and eliminate
unsuccessful solutions to the problem. Troubleshooting on your own means that
when you _do_ reach out, you'll be able to ask better, more specific questions.

## Reach Out to Your Peers via Slack

There is a good chance that fellow students have encountered similar challenges
to yours. Use the Slack channels available to you to get help.

Equally, if you find someone asking a question that you can provide insight on,
please do! One of the best ways to confirm your own understanding of a concept
is to try and help someone else understand it.

## Ask a Question

Many aspects of learning are inherently social, and it helps to talk problems
through with individuals who have experienced many of the same problems as you!
That’s where the Ask a Question Technical Coaches (TCs) come in.

### Who are TCs?

TCs help students get unstuck and guide students through pair programming. TCs
are a team of Flatiron graduates, so they are intimately familiar with Flatiron
School's curriculum. Some are recent graduates, and some are currently at other
development jobs outside of Flatiron. With this experience, they are perfectly
suited to give you a nudge in the right direction!

### Who We Serve

Technical Coaches provide support for the programs listed in
[this article][supported tracks]. At any given time there may be 2-5 TCs online;
staffing is based on how busy it **typically** is during that time of day. Sometimes
it gets very busy in AAQ unexpectedly! At any given time, there may be anywhere
from 1-15 active questions (sometimes more!). Please be patient with us as we
try to help.

### Get Help In Real Time

One of the great things about AAQ is the responsiveness of TCs - when TCs are
online, you can generally expect to receive a response within a couple of
minutes, provided that it isn’t very busy! While you can open a question in AAQ
at any time of day,
[TCs are only available for certain hours of the day][hours]. TCs generally
support students through chat in AAQ and through 20-minute pairing sessions over
Zoom.

You can ask a question by clicking the “Ask A Question” button at the bottom of
your current lesson or lab.

![AskAQuestion](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/aaq-button.png)

Clicking this button will display a form where you can submit your question.

**Questions must be related to the current lesson or lab that you are working on.**
AAQ does not support questions related to portfolio projects, code challenges,
or other personal projects.

AAQ exists to help Flatiron students learn to debug their issues successfully.
As mentioned, we do encourage you to first attempt your own troubleshooting to
help narrow down the issue you're facing and eliminate possible solutions.

That being said, sometimes you are just stuck and truly need a hand - if you
have tried the above solutions for 20-30 minutes, please feel free to open a
question! We are happy to help. This article provides some pointers on
[how to ask a question effectively.][how to]

### Why do Technical Coaches Not Give Out Answers?

The goal at AAQ is to help students learn how to think critically about code -
this doesn’t happen if we give you answers directly! We use a few different
general strategies to help accomplish this goal:

- We use the [Socratic method][] and other questioning techniques.
- We may recommend that you Google certain concepts, or give you suggestions on
  terms to Google
- We may provide you with additional resources on a relevant coding concept to
  supplement your understanding or help you to think about a problem differently
- We may provide you with some [pseudocode][] or guide you to construct some
  pseudocode yourself!

## Conclusion

Ask A Question is here to help support you as you continue your journey to learn
to code. While ultimately you must hold yourself accountable for learning the
concepts in this course, and for developing your debugging skills as a
programmer, we are here to support you! If you are stuck, do not hesitate to ask
for help!
